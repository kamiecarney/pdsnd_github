### Explore US Bikeshare Data with Python

### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data provided by Motivate related to bike share systems for three major cities. I wrote code to compare the  usage between the cities of Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

##### The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 were provided for all three cities.

#### Statistics Computed

*Popular times of travel*
* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

*Popular stations and trip*
* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

*Trip duration*
* total travel time
* average travel time

*User info*
* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
The files used were:
* washington.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* chicago.csv
